Stitched Output
===========
Files in this folder are generated by knitr, and reflect some data manipulation occurring in the project.  The report (archived through Git) helps identify changes in the datasets through the life of the project.  Differences in the report over time could reflect changes in the:

 * **datasets** collected outside of this project (and thus outside the control of the repository's code).
 * **manipulation code** that modifies the raw/given datasets into datasets used in the analysis.
 * **software** versions (include R, installed packages, and libraries that the packages call).
